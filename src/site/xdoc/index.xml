                This plugin allows you to create portlets representing tag clouds.
                Each tag is associated with an URL and its size can range from 1 to 10
                according to its importance.
                <br/>
                The cloud configuration is done in the BackOffice by entering the tags, their size and their associated link.
                <br/>
                The publication of the cloud is done through the Site Administration feature by adding a portlet of type "Tag Cloud" and selecting the cloud to display.            </subsection>
